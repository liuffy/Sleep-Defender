## Sleep Defender :sleeping: :space_invader:

### Background

Sleep Defender is a riff on the 1981 classic space shooter game [Defender](http://www.classicgamesarcade.com/game/21638/defender.html). Drawing inspiration from the classics Space Invaders and Asteroids, Defender is 2D sidescrolling game set in which the player's objective is twofold: 

1. Defeat waves of invading aliens
2. Protect astronauts on the landscape from being abducted by said aliens

Eventually, the player wins the game by surviving the waves of aliens.

'Sleep Defender' aims to capture the essence and spirit of this game while giving it a modern take. The player is a pajama - clad person who must defend their bed from waves of objects that might interrupt their sleep - alarm clocks, cans of energy drinks, cups of coffee. The player wins if they are able to clear the screen of these moving objects without being hit more than three times or having their bed "abducted". 


### Functionality & MVP  

With this game, users will be able to:

- [ ] Start, pause, and reset the game.
- [ ] Move their character up, down, left, and right.
- [ ] Fire projectiles at enemy objects to destroy them.
- [ ] Hear sound effects for:
1. The firing of projectiles
2. Being hit by an enemy object and hitting an enemy object

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] An Instructions modal describing the objective of and controls for the game
- [ ] The ability to play or mute background music. 

### Wireframes

This app will have a single screen with the game board, game statistics (lives remaining and percentage of enemy objects eliminated), game controls, and links to my pages (Github, Linkedin, Portfolio site). 

There will also be a '?' button that will allow the player to re-read the directions if they need to.

The player's object will start at the bottom of the screen. They'll be able to move left, right up, up, and down (it's not really explained why they float, but hey, this is a game where you fight cans of energy drinks!). Enemy objects will move towards the player (calculated based on which quadrant the player's sprite is located in)

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and game logic,
- `Pixi.js` with `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and rendering,
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

In addition to the webpack entry file, there will be three scripts involved in this project:

`pajamer.js` - Handles the player's movement around the board
`projectile.js` - Handles the movement of projectile generated by the player
`enemies.js` - Generates the objects that attempt to collide with either the bed or the player 
`game.js` - Defines the game rules of winning/losing. Also updates the board.


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1: Basic rendering**
- [X] Setup all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and running installing `Pixi.js`.  
- [X] Create `webpack.config.js` as well as `package.json`.  
- [X] Learn the basics of `Pixi.js`. Complete the first part of the [Learning Pixi JS](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi) tutorial on Github
- [ ] Write a basic entry file and the bare bones of all 3 scripts outlined above. Attempt to render the background and the player's object on screen (likely a basic sprite in place of the final ones).  


**Day 2: Get the player's character moving back and forth. Create enemy objects objects.**
- [X] Have the player's character respond to key presses - keymaster added
- [ ] Player faces the direction they're moving in (left vs. right) - need flipped sprite for this
- [ ] Create enemy objects (with different appearances but functioning identically) that can at least move around randomly 


**Day 3: Finetune moving of enemy objects, missiles**
- [ ] Enemy objects should move towards the player based on the quadrant that the player is located in
- [ ] Create missiles that fire to the left or right (depending on which side the character is facing)


**Day 4: Hit detection (losing and winning)**
- [ ] When a missile from the player hits an enemy, that enemy is cleared from the board.
- [ ] LOSING: When the bed is hit by an enemy object, the game ends.
- [ ] WINNING: If the player clears the board of enemies, they win the game! 
- [ ] `You win!` modal
- [ ] `You lose!` modal

**Day 5: Player's lives, sound effects**
- [ ] When the player is hit by an enemy object, the enemy object is cleared from the board, but they lose a life (out of 3 total lives)
- [ ] Add sounds for the following effects:
  * Background music - instrumental version of Rock-a-bye Baby? :full_moon_with_face:
	* Missile hitting enemy
	* Enemy hitting player, bed
- [ ] Add `mute` button 

**Day 6: Polishing the game and gaming experience**
- [ ] Replace basic sprites with more beautiful sprites
- [ ] Add `restart` and `help` button (which opens the Instructional modal)
  - [ ] `?` button re-displays the Instructions modal 
 	- [ ] `Help` button pauses the game 
	- [ ] `Restart` button restarts the game


### Bonus features :sparkles:

There are many expansion opportunities for the game, such as:

- [ ] SIDE SCROLLING! Truly imitating its predecessor. 
- [ ] Keeping track of points. 
- [ ] Different enemies have different characteristics (type of movement, speed, sound effects)
- [ ] Different levels
